<h1>The PiClass Project</h1>

<p>
	Raspberry Pi Traveling Classroom - The project goal is to provide a 
	traveling computer lab with some robotics component using Raspberry Pi.
	The classroom can support half a class, ie from 10 to 12 students.
</p>

<h2>For who is it ?</h2>

<p>
	In a first round the project is destined to primary Swiss classes 
	located in the french speaking side of Switzerland. The workshop
	activities are also avalaible for non profit associations working
	with youg kids and teen.
</p>

<p>
	In a second round we will provide our services all over the world
	between jully and august. Depending on the communty grown and needs,
	we will provide some formations to teachers and help to setup a local
	PiClass lab.
</p>

<h2>How much it will cost ?</h2>

<p>
	The Raspberry Pi micro computer and the electronics components we
	selected are low cost, energy efficient and where created for 
	educationnal purpose. A single machine cost only 35 $, it let us
	have a standard graphical desktop with educative applications as
	well has playing with robotics, create electronics circuits and
	learn programming.
</p>

<p>
	First we will start with a Kickstarter fundraising. Then we will
	need an annual budget to pay soldier and reparations, this will
	cost arounf 350 $ by year.
