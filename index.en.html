<h1>The PiClass Project</h1>

<p>
	Raspberry Pi Travelling Classroom - The project goal is to provide a 
	travelling computer lab with some robotics components using a Raspberry Pi.
	The classroom can support half a class, ie from 10 to 12 students and
	will travel between school buildings in a suitcase on wheels!

<p>
	Check out our Twitter feed for latest news about the project:
	<a href="https://twitter.com/pi_class">@pi_class</a> and you may
	also be interested by some informations about our
	<a href="projects/index.en.html">active projects</a>.
</p>

<h2>Who is it for?</h2>

<p>
	In the first round, the project is designed for primary Swiss classes 
	located in the French speaking part of Switzerland. The workshop
	activities are also available for non profit associations working
	with young kids and teens.
</p>

<p>
	In the second round, we will provide our services all over the world
	between July and August. Depending on the communty growth and needs,
	we will provide some instructions to teachers and help to setup a local
	PiClass lab.
</p>

<h2>How much it will cost ?</h2>

<p>
	The Raspberry Pi micro computer and the electronics components we
	selected are low cost, energy efficient and were created for 
	educational purposes. A single machine costs only $35, it lets us
	have a standard graphical desktop with educational applications 
	that can play with robotics, create electronics circuits and
	teach programming.
</p>

<p>
	First we will start with a Kickstarter fundraising. Then we will
	need an annual budget to pay volunteers and reparations, this will
	cost around $350 a year.
</p>

<p>
	Estimated cost for a minimal PiClass providing 10 workplace for students:

<!-- Total -->
<p>
	Total: 2000 $ without shipping
</p>

<p>
	For a more complete PiClass we need 8x8 LED Matrix (100 $), 
	temperature sensors (50 $), a few PiCam (150 $) and some more leds
	(50 $). So we will try to reach 2400 $ with the fundraising and 
	sponsors.
