<h1>The PiClass Project</h1>

<p>
	Raspberry Pi Travelling Classroom - The project goal is to provide a 
	travelling computer lab with some robotics components using a Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<p>
	The classroom can support half a class, ie from 10 to 12 students and
	can travel between school buildings in a suitcase on wheels!
</p>

<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>
	Check out our Twitter feed for latest news about the project:
	<a href="https://twitter.com/pi_class">@pi_class</a> 
</p>

<p>
	You may also be interested by some information about our
	<a href="projects/index.en.html">active projects</a>.
</p>

<h2>Who is it for?</h2>

<p>
	In the first round, the project is designed for primary Swiss classes 
	located in the French speaking part of Switzerland. The workshop
	activities are also available for non profit associations working
	with young kids and teens.
</p>

<p>
	We also have a PiClass project in Brazil for Summer 2015 designed
	for schools and non-profit associations in São Paulo.
</p>

<p>
	In the second round, we will provide our services all over the world
	between July and August. Depending on the community growth and needs,
	we will provide some instructions to teachers and help to setup a local
	PiClass lab.
</p>

<h2>How much it will cost ?</h2>

<p>
	The Raspberry Pi micro computer and the electronics components we
	selected are low cost, energy efficient and were created for 
	educational purposes. A single machine costs only $35, it lets us
	have a standard graphical desktop with educational applications 
	that can play with robotics, create electronics circuits and
	teach programming.
</p>

<p>
	First we will start with an online fundraising. Then we will need an
	annual budget to pay volunteers and reparations, this will cost 
	around $350 a year. Here is the cost for a minimal PiClass providing
	10 workplaces for students:

<!-- Total -->
<p>
	Total: $2000 without shipping
</p>

<p>
	For a more complete PiClass we need a few PiCams ($150) and some
	more leds ($50).
</p>

<!-- Fundraising -->

<h2 id="fundraising">Fundraising the first Piclass</h2>

<p>
	The first Piclass fundraising for the first PiClass workshop will
	start on Saturday 9 August 2014.
</p>

<p>
	The goal is to have 10 Raspberry Pi workplaces for students. The material
	will be used for school lessons, workshops and open Jams. It will
	belong to the non-profit SliTaz GNU/Linux association until we have
	an official PIClass non-profit association in Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
	The first PiClass will start in September 2014, so we need the basic 
	hardware to start, then we need to complete the list until the end of October.
	This gives us only a short time to get help and order the material.
</p>

<p>
	Stay tuned!
</p>

<h2>Workshop duration</h2>

<p>
	The duration of a workshop will depend on the budget of the school or
	the representative organization's needs and desires about the classroom
	goals and the school plan. The PiClass can take place over at least a
	morning and can last up to one year for a big project. In short, it will
	fit. The duration of a lesson is 45 minutes. Here are some examples:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Maths with LEDs or how to spot on a grid creating drawings 
		in a single afternoon (2 lessons)</li>
	<li>
		Introduction to the use of a computer and educational games: a 
		full morning (4 lessons)
	</li>
	<li>
		Building a robot, inc. soldering and programming: 8-10 lessons over
		the school year
	</li>
	<li>
		Development of a weather station to be used in sciences: 1 morning,
		then 1 afternoon (6 lessons)
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What will the children learn</h2>

<p>
	Generally children will learn to use a computer properly, to manage 
	their files in a structured way, to control educational games, explore
	the hardware and turn off the machine when finished. They will learn
	to implement an experimental, explorational and observational device.
</p>

<p>
	Through the creation of a small website, children also learn to use
	the keyboard, create and manipulate images, and identify different parts
	of a website. At the same time they will improve their English writing 
	skills.
</p>

<p>
	Through small electronic assemblies or a grid of LEDs, we reach 
	educational goals such as the description of a path in its familiar
	space indicating the points of departure, points of arrival and 
	directions to take. So we can do math with leds!
</p>

<p>
	PiClass comes with a bunch of free software especially designed for 
	children from 4 to 10 years old. From a simple memory game to 
	Python or Scratch programming students will discover, play and learn.
</p>

<h2>The Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>
	The Raspberry Pi is a mini computer the size of a credit card. It is
	supplied as a single mother card (without housing, power supply, 
	keyboard, mouse and screen) with the aim to reduce costs and allow the
	use of recycled materials.
</p>

<p>
	This computer is designed to encourage the learning of computer
	programming. However, it is sufficiently open (2 USB ports and 
	one RJ45 1) and powerful (ARM 700 MHz, 512 MB RAM) to allow a wide
	range of uses.

<h2>Code &amp; documentation</h2>

<p>
	PiClass documentation and records for students are managed from 
	GitHub. Guides for teachers about the use of Linux and Raspberry Pi
	system are managed from SliTaz Hg repositories.
</p>

<p>
	The complete guide on SliTaz and the Raspberry Pi is already written
	and can be found in the SliTaz ARM Codex:
	<a href="http://arm.slitaz.org/codex/pibook.html">PiBook</a>
</p>

<p>
	In order to have a wide range of tools for young students, the PiClass
	project develops some example scripts, GUIs and is very actively involved 
	in the <a href="http://www.slitaz.org/en/">SliTaz GNU/Linux</a>
	distribution.
